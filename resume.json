    "summary": "I'm a developer studying media informatics in Stuttgart, Germany. But my passion for computers started way earlier. My first attempt at creating video games at 8 years of age was drawing race tracks in Paint that one could 'drive' on with the pen tool. Since then I've been hooked by the idea that you can use technology to create anything you can imagine. Software development is a fast moving field which I enjoy because there is always something new to learn and try out. In my code I strive for simple and elegant solutions, but it's not an end in self. Building applications that are easy to use and solve the user's problem is even more important. This part of software development is just as interesting as solving the technical challenges.",
